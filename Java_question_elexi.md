Assessment on two aspects
1) Hands on coding
 
https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/
Solve all stack, linked list, recursion, sorting, Binary tree, BST, Divide & Conquer
 
 
 
2) JAVA
 
1. Java Memory Model (JMM)
Memory consistency errors // it happened while multithreading, use volatile, synchronized to solve
 
Happens-before relationship
 
Visibility and atomicity
 
Thread synchronization and locking mechanisms
 
Volatile keyword
 
Final fields and immutability
 
2. Concurrency and Multithreading
Thread lifecycle
 
Thread synchronization (e.g., synchronized keyword, Lock interface)
 
Concurrency utilities (e.g., ExecutorService, Semaphore, CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier)
 
Fork/Join framework
 
Concurrent collections (e.g., CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap)
 
Thread safety
 
Deadlocks and livelocks
 
Executors and thread pools
 
Atomic variables (AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, AtomicReference)
 
3. Reflection API
Accessing and modifying fields and methods at runtime
 
Dynamic proxies
 
Annotations
 
Class loading mechanisms
 
Method invocation using reflection
 
Reflection-based frameworks (e.g., Spring)
 
4. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Internals
JVM architecture (Classloader, garbage collection, execution engine, etc.)
 
JVM tuning (heap size, garbage collection algorithms)
 
JVM garbage collectors (e.g., G1 GC, Parallel GC, CMS)
 
JVM performance optimizations
 
JVM diagnostics (JConsole, VisualVM, JVM metrics)
 
JIT compilation (Just-In-Time compilation and HotSpot optimization)
 
Heap dumps, memory leaks
 
5. Java 8+ Features
Lambda expressions
 
Streams API
 
Functional interfaces
 
Method references
 
Default methods in interfaces
 
Optional class
 
CompletableFuture and asynchronous programming
 
New Date and Time API (java.time)
 
6. Design Patterns
Creational Patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype)
 
Structural Patterns (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Composite, Facade, Proxy)
 
Behavioral Patterns (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, State, Iterator)
 
Concurrency Patterns (e.g., Producer-Consumer, Thread Pool)
 
10. Java Security
Authentication and authorization (e.g., JAAS, OAuth)
 
Cryptography (e.g., MessageDigest, Cipher, KeyPair, SecureRandom)
 
Digital signatures and certificates
 
SSL/TLS connections
 
Java Security Manager and Policies
 
11. Java Streams and Reactive Programming
Reactive programming with Project Reactor and RxJava
 
Backpressure and flow control
 
Publisher, Subscriber, and Operators in RxJava
 
Monads, Futures, and CompletionStage
13. Java 9+ Modules System
Module declaration (module-info.java)


1.  time complexity of Arraylist vs Linkedlist
2.  time complexity to search a 5th element of Arraylist vs Linkedlist
3.  time complexity of forloop
 
Module dependencies
 
Service loader mechanism
 
Jigsaw project (Java platform modularization)
